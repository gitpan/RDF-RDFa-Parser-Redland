NAME
    RDF::RDFa::Parser::Redland - Parses RDFa into a RDF::Redland::Model.

VERSION
    0.30

SYNOPSIS
      use LWP::Simple qw(get);
      use RDF::RDFa::Parser::Redland;
  
      my $uri    = 'http://example.com/rdfa-enabled-page.xhtml';
      my $parser = RDF::RDFa::Parser::Redland->new(get($uri), $uri);
      $parser->consume;
      my $model  = $parser->graph;

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends RDF::RDFa::Parser to be able to output an
    RDF::Redland::Model.

    The "graph" method will return a Redland model instead of the
    RDF::Trine::Model that "RDF::RDFa::Parser::graph" returns.

    Other than that it should have an identical API to RDF::RDFa::Parser.

BUGS
    RDF::RDFa::Parser::Redland 0.21 passes all approved tests in the W3C's
    XHTML+RDFa test suite.

    There seem to be one or two problems using the named graphs feature, but
    I've not had a chance to discover if the problems are in this package or
    in RDF::Redland (probably the former). The named graphs feature is only
    useful in a very small set of cases, and is disabled by default.

    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
